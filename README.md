# Optimizing College Campus Canvassing: Dorm-Storming Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes door-knocking response rates to optimize 'dorm-storming' efforts at UNC Chapel Hill. Each dorm was assigned a ‘fruitfulness’ score to guide canvassing strategies for maximum impact.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Filtering**: Filtered out dorms without sufficient data and converted engagement metrics into usable formats.
2. **Calculating Fruitfulness Score**: Created a composite score based on three engagement factors, with custom weights for optimized ranking.
3. **Visual Analysis**: Developed bar charts to visualize dorm rankings by overall fruitfulness and specific engagement metrics.

### Findings
- **Top Dorms by Fruitfulness**: Morrison, Hardin, and Carmichael scored highest, with consistent engagement across all metrics.
- **Visuals**: The notebook includes visualizations of dorms by fruitfulness score, average response percentage, and average doors answered.

### Limitations
The analysis was limited by the lack of time-based and floor-specific data.
